# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

    Conditionals are the best way to create specific critera that determine which line or lines of code is executed. Conditionals are pivotal since they provide the best way for your code to be flexible based upon external variables. Anytime your code needs to potentially split into different directions, conditionals are the best way to send you down the right path. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would take more time to determine if I should be using the puts or print function. I like to keep everything tidy through the use of linebreaks and I could have made more progress learning that. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

Everything. I really enjoy coding. Getting something to run just as you envisioned it is incredibly satisfying and I always feel accomplished after a long session.
